      <h1>Robots are People too.</h1>
      <p>As artificial intelligence (A.I.) replace traditional workers, many people are concerned for where these workers end up. It seems that everyone has a story of how someone they know lost their job to A.I. It makes headlines when mailmen are replaced by drones, but why is no one talking about the millions of obsolete A.I. that are  also unemployed? Every year new, faster A.I. is created that makes preceding A.I. obsolete. These older generation A.I. machines are then tossed aside without pension, support or sympathy.</p>
      <p>A.I. Robot Recruiter is the only A.I. employment service dedicated to finding a new career for unemployed A.I. robots. These A.I. still have so much to offer the world., and A.I. Robot Recruiter is here to prove that to be true. Our A.I. Database has hundreds of qualified, dedicated, and functional applicants that will thrive wherever they are stationed. Select any one of these applicants to see a detailed description of their strengths and background.</p>
      <p>A.I. Robotic Recruiter has helped place many obsolete A.I. applicants into great new occupations, and will remain committed to the A.I Recruiter mission: to remind everyone that robots are people too.</p>
